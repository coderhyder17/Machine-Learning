    "Naive bayes algorithm is a classification technique based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. A Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. Even if the features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that a particular fruit is an apple or an orange or a banana.\n",
